Abstract
===
Global warming has increased the frequency of floods around the world. These floods destroy the environment and create navigational problems for rescue operations. This paper presents a novel probabilistic mapping technique that fuses the surface and underwater information using Octomaps to deliver the obstacle map of an unstructured area. An adaptive obstacle detection algorithm retrieves underwater information from a forward-looking high-frequency sonar, whereas a three-dimensional LiDAR maps the surface water environment. The mapping methodology is tested at several shallow water bodies, and promising results are provided.
