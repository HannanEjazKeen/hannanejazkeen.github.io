Abstract
===
Climate researchers predict that heavy rain and flooding are becoming more frequent due to global warming. Flooding alters environments by raising the water level, creating new waterways, destroying buildings and roads. Due to these drastic changes, existing environmental maps become outdated and can only be used to a limited extent as references for planning and navigation tasks in disaster areas. This work proposes deploying semi-autonomous robotic systems to map the environmental conditions below and above water. Rescue forces then use the collected information for operation planning and navigation. The proposed concept is exemplified by a prototypical raft, a commercial water drone, and a crewed pontoon boat. Although the vehicle classes and propulsion systems differ, all three systems use the same control architecture. The architecture is a specialization of the behavior-based REACTiON framework for commercial land vehicles with a focus on off-road scenarios.
