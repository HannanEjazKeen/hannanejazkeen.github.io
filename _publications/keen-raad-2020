Abstract
===
We propose a system, which generates a precise elevation map of natural rough terrain. It uses basic sensors such as LiDAR and Stereo camera to generate point clouds. Based on the requirements of high precision, specific techniques are integrated to receive adequate maps in real-time. The presented methodology allows an easy extension of existing maps.
