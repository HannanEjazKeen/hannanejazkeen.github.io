As a robotics engineer with over seven years of experience, I specialize in the design, development, and implementation of autonomous robotic systems. My expertise includes programming and debugging robots using C++ and Python, with a focus on creating various types of drones—including aerial, off-road, and water drones—primarily for mapping and autonomous navigation purposes.

I am proficient in multisensor system development, utilizing a variety of sensors such as LiDAR, RGB and multispectral cameras, RADAR sensors, and forward-looking multibeam sonars. My commitment to innovation extends to my robust problem-solving abilities, bolstered by strong analytical and technical skills.

Throughout my career, I have successfully collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure the timely and precise completion of projects. I am dedicated to delivering innovative and efficient robotic solutions that meet diverse industrial requirements, as evidenced by my substantial experience in running 3D simulations and developing V2X-based mobility solutions.

As an environmentalist who believes in combating global warming, I strive to create eco-friendly solutions. This commitment is reflected in my academic and professional work. My PhD thesis focused on developing traversability mapping solutions for post-flood environments to enhance the reliability and robustness of rescue operations. My master's thesis centered on the energy-efficient collaborative navigation of aerial vehicles using reinforcement learning while my bachelor's thesis involved designing an energy-efficient autonomous room-cleaning robot.

Driven by a passion for advancing autonomous technology and providing cutting-edge solutions to complex challenges, I continuously seek to push the boundaries of what is possible in the field of robotics.
